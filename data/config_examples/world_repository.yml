# Example world_repository.yml
#
# This file is an example of a minimal world repository descriptor.
# It is provided for reference and is not used directly by the tools.
#
# Typical usage:
# - Copy this file into your world repository (commonly under _meta/descriptors/)
# - Edit the values (especially world_root) to match your local setup
#
# The exact location of the active descriptor file is up to the user and
# is supplied to tools explicitly as a parameter.
#

# This file describes how a world's accumulated materials are organized.
# This includes where source materials are stored, where machine-generated
# work-in-progress outputs may be written, and which world descriptors apply.
#
# This file describes the structure of the world repository itself.
# It does not describe world lore, geography, or canon.
#

# Minimum required info:
# - where does everything start?
# - what should be read?
# - where can output be written?
# ---------------------

# Absolute path to the root of the world's file structure.
# This directory contains all world content, metadata, and local working files.
# Paths in this file are resolved relative to this root.
# Example (macOS):
#   /Users/yourname/Documents/Campaign Directory
# Example (Windows):
#   C:\Users\yourname\Documents\Campaign Directory
world_root: /absolute/path/to/your/world/root

sources:
  # Where tools are allowed to read source materials from.
  # Multiple entries are allowed.
  # Relative paths are resolved under world_root unless an absolute path is given.
  read_paths:
    - _local/auto_transcripts
    - _local/pbp_transcripts
    - _local/planning_notes
    - _local/recollections
    - _local/session_notes

working_drafts:
  # Location for machine-generated working drafts.
  # These files are provisional, reproducible, and safe to delete.
  # This directory is expected to be ignored by version control.
  #
  # Relative paths are resolved under world_root unless an absolute path is given.

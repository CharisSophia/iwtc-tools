# IWTC-Tools Progress Report - January 8, 2026

## [Project Summary]
This milestone captures the creation and stabilization of a new **raw source indexing workflow notebook**. Following the environment and tooling stabilization completed on December 23, this work operationalizes the next planned step: controlled discovery, review, and normalization of raw narrative sources in preparation for indexing.

---

## 1. New Raw Source Indexing Notebook
- Established a dedicated notebook focused exclusively on **raw source indexing workflow execution**.
- Clarified scope to exclude chunking, semantic indexing, and retrieval logic.
- Moved conceptual design out of the notebook and into documentation, keeping the notebook execution-focused.

**Key Learning:**  
Separating design intent from executable workflow improves both clarity and iteration speed.

---

## 2. Descriptor-Driven Source Configuration
- Integrated the notebook with `world_repository.yml` for all source configuration.
- Extended the descriptor to support typed source paths (`{path, type}`).
- Preserved backward compatibility for untyped sources.

**Key Learning:**  
Human-authored descriptors are the correct authority for source semantics; tooling should not infer intent.

---

## 3. Deterministic Source Discovery
- Implemented recursive discovery of supported source files (`.md`, `.docx`, `.txt`).
- Ensured deterministic ordering and stable numeric IDs across runs.
- Associated each discovered file with its declared source type.

**Key Learning:**  
Stable identifiers must be assigned at discovery time, not reconstructed later.

---

## 4. Human-Guided Source Selection
- Added grouped display of candidate files by directory.
- Implemented explicit selection modes:
  - `SOURCE_MODE="ALL"`
  - `SOURCE_MODE="PROMPT"` with ID and range selection
- Ensured selection is auditable and repeatable.

**Key Learning:**  
Human review is a first-class step in narrative indexing workflows, not an afterthought.

---

## 5. Source Normalization
- Implemented normalized, line-oriented loading for selected sources.
- Added sanity-check previews to validate normalization output.
- Confirmed readiness for downstream chunking without further restructuring.

**Key Learning:**  
Normalization is the correct handoff boundary between ingestion and indexing.

---

## 6. Current Baseline State
- Raw source indexing notebook exists and executes cleanly
- Descriptor-driven configuration is fully wired
- Discovery, selection, and normalization are stable
- Environment remains consistent with the December 23 baseline

This baseline is now considered **ready for chunking rule development**.

---

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Define Chunking Rules**
   - By file type and declared source type
   - Explicit, inspectable, and overrideable

2. **Attach Index Metadata**
   - Session identifiers
   - Arcs, locations, and character hints

3. **Apply Workflow to Additional Worlds**
   - Validate reuse across IWTC and Bryncross

---

**Current Status:**  
The raw source indexing workflow is implemented, stable, and unblocked.  
The project is ready to proceed into chunking and indexing logic.

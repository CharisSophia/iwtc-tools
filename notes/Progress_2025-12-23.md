# IWTC-Tools Progress Report - December 23, 2025

## [Project Summary]
This milestone captures the successful stabilization of the IWTC tooling environment following the repository rename from `iwtc-lab` to `iwtc-tools`. The local development environment, Jupyter notebooks, kernels, and documentation have been repaired, verified, and brought back to a clean, known-good state suitable for continued automation and indexing work.

---

## 1. Environment & Tooling
- Rebuilt local **Python 3.11** virtual environment (`.venv`) at the new repository path.
- Installed **JupyterLab 4.x** inside the project-scoped virtual environment.
- Registered a new Jupyter kernel: **Python (iwtc-tools)**.
- Removed stale kernels referencing the deprecated `iwtc-lab` path.
- Verified kernel selection and interpreter paths inside active notebooks.

**Key Learning:**  
After repository renames, virtual environments and Jupyter kernels must be rebuilt and re-registered; stale interpreter paths do not self-heal.

---

## 2. Repository & Rename Cleanup
- Completed transition from **iwtc-lab** to **iwtc-tools**.
- Eliminated all remaining references to the old repository path in:
  - virtual environment shebangs
  - Jupyter kernelspecs
  - notebook metadata
- Confirmed consistent project root resolution under the new name.

**Key Learning:**  
Jupyter notebooks retain kernelspec metadata that must be explicitly updated after environment or path changes.

---

## 3. Notebook State
- All notebooks in `notebooks/` now:
  - Open without interpreter errors
  - Bind automatically to **Python (iwtc-tools)**
  - Execute cleanly in the rebuilt environment
- Notebook kernelspec metadata updated in bulk to prevent regressions.

**Key Learning:**  
Bulk-editing notebook metadata is safer and more repeatable than manual kernel reassignment.

---

## 4. Documentation Repair
- Repaired Markdown fencing errors in `README.md` that caused sections to render incorrectly on GitHub.
- Corrected code block boundaries and ensured all fenced blocks close on their own lines.
- Updated Environment documentation to reflect the current, working setup.

**Key Learning:**  
GitHub-flavored Markdown requires fenced code blocks to open and close on separate lines; inline closing backticks do not terminate a block.

---

## 5. Current Baseline State
- Repository: **iwtc-tools**
- Python: **3.11.x**
- Environment: project-local `.venv`
- Jupyter kernel: **Python (iwtc-tools)**
- Notebooks: clean, executable, and stable
- Documentation: rendering correctly on GitHub

This baseline is now considered **stable**.

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Resume Raw Session Notes Indexing Work**
   - Implement semi-automated segmentation and indexing for legacy session notes.
   - Introduce dry-run → human approval → apply workflow.

2. **Refactor Existing Notebooks**
   - Align exploratory notebooks with `iwtc-tools` module structure.
   - Reduce reliance on ad-hoc path manipulation.

3. **Tool Configuration by World**
   - Formalize per-world configuration (IWTC vs Bryncross).
   - Externalize arc vocabularies, locations, and character aliases.

---

**Current Status:**  
Development environment and documentation are fully stabilized post-rename.  
Project is unblocked and ready to continue focused tooling and automation work.
